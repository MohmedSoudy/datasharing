   <h2 style="color: Navy;">Introduction</h2>
   
   **Introduction:**
   - MicroRNA Childhood Cancer Catalog (M3Cs) has developed a framework to qualitatively standardize the definition of the 'clinical validity' of a microRNA-childhood cancer disease relationship as a Diagnostic / Prognostic/ Predictive/ Risk Factor Biomarker tool using a well-defined classification scheme based on the strength of evidence that supports or contradicts the claimed relationship. 
</div>
<br>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
   <h2 style="color: Navy;">Aims</h2>
   
   **Aims:**
   - This framework enables the team of M3Cs version 2.0 to do systematic evaluation of the 'clinical validity' of a microRNA-childhood cancer disease relationship.
   - This framework enables researchers to prioritize microRNAs for analysis in various clinical contexts.

   <h2 style="color: Navy;">Scoring Steps:</h2>
   
   **Step 1: Evaluate the quality elements for individual studies as Yes, No, Partially, Unclear, or Not Relevant** [adapted from ASCO guidelines development process (1) and  CPIC (2)]:
   
   - Sample size adequate to assess the difference between compared groups, especially for negative findings (3).
   - Adequate methods used:
     - Appropriate attainment of samples.
  	 - Clear identification of the time points and the source of the collected samples.
  	 - State all approaches used (profiling/discovery or candidate-miRNA identification approaches).
  	 - Adequate platform used in the profiling/discovery stage.
  	 - State all miRNAs screened in the candidate-miRNA identification approach. 
  	 - State miRNA status as 'single or panel'.
 	 - States all genetic variants screened (if applicable).
  	 - Adequate phenotyping or genotyping method used (if applicable).
  	 - Alleles tested are adequate to determine 'wild-type' genotype(if applicable).
  	 - Clearly states which miRNA dysregulation was found in the study.
  	 - Clearly states which genotypes were found in the study (if applicable).
  	 - Defines how * alleles are defined (if applicable).
   - Ancestry is discussed and appropriately considered.
   - Outcome definition clearly defined and measured.
   - Appropriate statistics were performed.

   **Step 2: Rate how the individual study supports the major finding statement** [adapted from ASCO guideline development process (1) and  CPIC (2)]:

   - First, determine if the study supports the major finding statement or does not support it.
   - Second, qualify the statement (if needed) based on the quality elements listed above:
     - Some study quality flaws: Enough of the items in step 1 is rated 'partially', 'unclear,' or 'no' to introduce some uncertainty about the validity of the conclusions.
  	 - Major study quality flaws: Enough of the items in step 1 are rated 'partially', 'unclear', or 'no' to introduce serious uncertainty about the validity of the conclusions.
  	 - No qualification on the statement is needed if a few items in step 1 are rated as 'partially', 'unclear', or 'no'.

   - There are six possible ratings:
     - Supports the statement. 
  	 - Supports the statement but with some quality flaws.
 	 - Supports the statement but with major quality flaws.
  	 - Does not support the statement.
  	 - Does not support the statement but with some quality flaws.
  	 - Does not support the statement but with major quality flaws.

   **Step 3: Rate how preclinical in vitro or in vivo studies support the major finding statement:** 

   - Supports the statement
   - Supports the statement but with some quality flaws
   - Supports the statement but with major quality flaws
   - Does not support the statement
   - Does not support the statement but with some quality flaws 
   - Does not support the statement but with major quality flaws
   - Note: M3Cs doesn't include in silico studies.

   **Step 4: Score each major finding statement based on all the evidence and studies that support that major finding using the following criteria. Scale modified slightly from Valdes et al. (4) and the ASCO guideline (1).**
   
   - **Strong:** Evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies. 'High confidence that the available evidence reflects the true magnitude and direction of the net effect and further research is very unlikely to change the magnitude or direction of this net effect.'
   - **Moderate:** Evidence is sufficient to determine effects, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual studies; generalizability to routine practice; or indirect nature of the evidence. 'Further research is unlikely to alter the direction of the net effect, however, it might alter the magnitude of the net effect.'
   - **Limited:** Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because of the limited number or power of studies, important flaws in their design or conduct, gaps in the chain of evidence, or lack of information. 'Further research may change the magnitude and/or direction of the net effect.'
