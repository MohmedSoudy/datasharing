   <strong>As, healthcare Policymakers reasoned the clinical validity and clinical utility of microRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic/predictive/risk biomarkers would be a necessary precondition for pivoting microRNA toward the diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, and screening as a broad adoption in different diseases.
    M3Cs <span style="color: red;">Version 2.0</span> the first specialized microRNA platform in childhood cancer that introduced ‘clinical validity’ for all microRNAs included in M3Cs  ‘Clinical Domain’ using 'Consensus of M3Cs Standardized Clinical Validity Framework 2024 Version 1.0' which was developed by a panel of experts in the field.
    </strong>
    <br>
    <strong>M3Cs <span style="color: red;"> Version 2.0 </span>utilized digital innovation, as a primer for the introduction of translational bioinformatics approaches and data-driven decision-making, to deliver a unique value microRNA platform. 
    Digital innovation fosters an agile and adaptive organizational strategy with the help of data-driven insights that were needed by M3Cs for evidence synthesis and implementation to move forward from translational bioinformatics to clinical validity toward clinical utility/application in childhood cancer.
    </strong>
    <strong>According to the United Nations SDGs ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages are essential to sustainable development.
    M3Cs <span style="color: red;">Version 2.0</span> seeks to contribute to the achievement of <span style="color: red;">SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) </span>, <span style="color: red;">SDG9 (Innovation and Infrastructure) </span>,
    and <span style="color: red;">SDG17 (Partnerships)</span> by providing high-quality specialized microRNA platform in translational bioinformatics, evidence synthesis, and clinical validity for childhood cancer diseases. 
    M3Cs <span style="color: red;"> Version 2.0</span> is a standard model that can be applied in other microRNA platforms of various diseases to promote their clinical utility.
