Dec 2019: Approved in EU. October 18, 2019: UCB and Amgen announced that following a re-examination procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has adopted a positive opinion recommending Marketing Authorization for EVENITY® (romosozumab) for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture and with no history of myocardial infarction or stroke. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for use throughout the European Union. A European Commission decision is expected by year-end 2019.
 July 2019: UCB appealed EMA's negative opinion. The European Medicines Agency recommended the refusal of the marketing authorisation for Evenity, a medicine intended for the treatment of osteoporosis. The Agency issued its opinion on 27 June 2019. The company that applied for authorisation, UCB Pharma S.A., may ask for re-examination of the opinion within 15 days of receiving the opinion. The Agency was concerned because the results suggested that patients given Evenity had an increased risk of serious effects on the heart or circulatory system, such as heart attacks or strokes. In addition, when all the data were looked at together, there were more deaths in patients aged over 75 years given the medicine. As it was unclear why the medicine appeared to increase the risk of heart and circulatory problems, and there was no obvious group of patients in whom the risk of these was lower, measures to reduce the risk could not readily be put in place. Approved in the US on April 9, 2019. First approved in Japan on January 8, 2019.

AZ's comprehensive pandemic response includes rapid mobilisation of AstraZeneca’s global research efforts to discover novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat progression of the COVID-19 disease. During the period, AstraZeneca announced it had licensed coronavirus-neutralising antibodies from Vanderbilt University, US, and plans to advance two of these monoclonal antibodies (AZD8895 and AZD1061) into clinical development as a potential combination therapy (AZD7442) for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. AstraZeneca has secured support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the US Department of Defense and BARDA for the Phase I trial and the manufacturing of the potential new medicine for testing in Phase I, which is expected to initiate in the second half of the year.
In July 2020, the UK Government announced an agreement in principle with AstraZeneca for the supply of one million doses of AZD7442, with deliveries anticipated to start as early as first half of 2021, should the monoclonal-antibody combination prove to be tolerated and effective in clinical trials.

June 9, 2020: AstraZeneca has licensed coronavirus-neutralising antibodies from Vanderbilt University, US, and plans to advance a pair of these mAbs into clinical development as a potential combination therapy for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. This agreement builds on the Company’s collaboration agreement with Vanderbilt, announced in April 2020.

Following rapid mobilisation of its global research efforts, AstraZeneca has evaluated the ability of more than 1,500 mAbs to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibit its capacity to infect healthy cells in a laboratory setting. Based on these pre-clinical results, the Company has signed an exclusive license to six candidate antibodies currently in Vanderbilt’s portfolio that target the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two mAbs from these six will progress into clinical evaluation as a combination approach within the next two months.

AstraZeneca has also signed an interagency agreement with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the US Department of Defense, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services, to support the company’s efforts to develop a mAb treatment against SARS-CoV-2, including a Phase I clinical trial and the manufacturing of the investigational product for testing in Phase I. AstraZeneca plans to progress a combination approach consisting of two mAbs that bind to distinct parts on the receptor binding domain. It is anticipated that the combination approach may increase the efficacy of the treatment and reduce the impact of any mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mAbs will also have an extended half-life, engineered using proprietary technology to extend their longevity in the body.

This decision is not related to any safety or efficacy concerns. A large portion of the resources released resulting from termination of the ADUHELM program will be redeployed in Biogen’s AD franchise. In January 2023, Biogen began a strategic review of its research and development efforts, including seeking potential partners or external financing for ADUHELM, as part of a focus on prioritizing the company’s portfolio. During this process, Biogen considered the time and investment required for the post-marketing confirmatory ENVISION study and the likely advancements in the field by the time of potential ADUHELM FDA traditional approval. Despite an extensive process, the company did not identify potential strategic partners or external financing. Biogen has recorded a one-time charge of approximately $60 million related to close out costs for the program in the fourth quarter of 2023. Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune and has terminated that license. The rights to aducanumab will revert to Neurimmune.
April 2022: Biogen Inc. has notified the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of its decision to withdraw its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for aducanumab for the treatment of the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.

Biogen’s MAA had been under review by the CHMP in response to the company’s request for a re-examination of the negative opinion the regulatory body issued in December 2021.
On December 17, 2021, Biogen announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency has adopted a negative opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for aducanumab. New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted in Japan in December 2020. It was disclosed in April 2021 that submission of MAA has been conducted in Brazil, Canada, Australia and Switzerland.

October 2019: Biogen and Eisai, Co., Ltd. announced that, after consulting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Biogen plans to pursue regulatory approval for aducanumab, an investigational treatment for early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Phase 3 EMERGE Study met its primary endpoint showing a significant reduction in clinical decline, and Biogen believes that results from a subset of patients in the Phase 3 ENGAGE Study who received sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab support the findings from EMERGE. After reviewing the data in consultation with the FDA, Biogen believes that the difference between the results of the new analysis of the larger dataset and the outcome predicted by the futility analysis was largely due to patients’ greater exposure to high dose aducanumab. 
March 2019: Biogen and Eisai announced they would terminate the Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE trials of aducanumab for early Alzheimer’s disease. A futility analysis run by an independent data-monitoring committee concluded that that trials would not reach their primary endpoint, the slowing of cognitive decline as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) In July 2018 Biogen completed enrollment in ENGAGE and EMERGE, the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab, Biogen’s anti-amyloid beta antibody candidate for early Alzheimer’s disease.

Korea was one of the first countries to be affected by the global pandemic.[3] Celltrion has identified the library of antibodies sourced from the blood of recovered patients in Korea, which are thought to be involved in neutralising the virus and may contribute to recovery from COVID-19. These antibodies are undergoing further screening processes to identify those that are most effective in neutralising the virus causing COVID-19. Once identified these will form the basis of the antiviral treatment to be tested through pre-clinical and clinical trials around the world in the third quarter of 2020.
As of April 3 2020, Celltrion initiates the second stage; selecting the therapeutic antibodies which are most potent for neutralising the infection, after completing the first phase of screening 300 potential antibody candidates to treat COVID-19. 
APRIL 13 2020, Celltrion announced that the company has successfully selected the most potent antibody candidates to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. 
Through a partnership with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Celltrion initially identified and secured 300 different types of antibodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. These were then screened based on their ability to bind to the virus spike protein. Celltrion was then able to capture a total of 38 potent neutralizing antibodies, of which, 14 are powerful neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. 
Following the selection of antibody candidates which demonstrate high potency in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Celltrion will begin cell-line development. Once this is completed, Celltrion aims to roll out mass production of the therapeutic antibody and, together with the KCDC, Celltrion will conduct efficacy and toxicity testing in mice and non-human primates.

The potential treatment will also be investigated for use as a preventative measure.
The Phase I clinical trial aims to enroll 32 healthy volunteers in collaboration with Chungnam National University Hospital. The study will evaluate the safety of the antiviral antibody treatment candidate in healthy participants who have not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The trial’s completion is expected by Q3 of this year.
Celltrion is set to conduct a further in-human Phase I clinical trial of the antiviral treatment candidate in mild COVID-19 patients across Europe, including the UK, which will be followed by global Phase II/III trials in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. Celltrion anticipates promising preliminary results from pivotal studies by the end of the year.
In addition, a clinical trial investigating the use of the potential antiviral antibody treatment as a preventative measure, by enrolling people in close contact with COVID-19 patients globally, is also planned. The topline data for this trial is anticipated in Q1 of 2021.
Furthermore, Celltrion has previously demonstrated its antiviral antibody treatment to be effective in neutralising the mutated G-variant strain (D614G variant), which is associated with the increased viral transmission and wide spread of COVID-19. The ultimate goal is to complete all clinical trials and obtain a commercialization permits for CT-P59 by the first half of 2021.

Alhemo was first approved by Health Canada in March 2023 for the treatment of patients who have FIX inhibitors and require routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes
April 24, 2023, Novo Nordisk received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the therapy, an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor antibody called concizumab.
Alhemo™ was approved by Health Canada on March 10, 2023. Health Canada approved Alhemo™, the first anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for people living with hemophilia B with inhibitors.1 Alhemo™ is indicated for the treatment of patients over the age of 12 with hemophilia B who have FIX inhibitors and require routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.1 
MAA evaluation started on Jan 26, 2023.
July 2022: Novo Nordisk expects to submit concizumab for regulatory approval for the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia A or B with inhibitors in the second half of 2022 in the US and Japan, and in 2023 in the EU and the UK.
Aug 2020: Phase 3 studies resumed.
March 2020: Novo Nordisk announced that two clinical trials in the concizumab Phase III programme (Explorer7 and Explorer8) and one clinical trial in the Phase II programme (Explorer5) have been paused. The three clinical trials were investigating concizumab prophylaxis treatment in haemophilia A and B patients regardless of inhibitor status. These results are certainly negative for concizumab and coupled with the previous failure of four TFPI inhibitors, is a major set-back for the TFPI inhibitor class. Novo Nordisk is yet to hold a press release on the progress of the drug but have suspended all ongoing clinical trials until further review. 
FDA granted concizumab Breakthrough Therapy designation for prophylaxis treatment of people with hemophilia B with inhibitors towards Factor VIII or Factor IX, and Orphan Drug designation for hemophilia A and B. Concizumab was granted Orphan Drug designation in the EU for treatment of hemophilia B.
Q3 2019 earnings release: In October 2019, Novo Nordisk initiated the explorer7 phase 3 clinical trial with concizumab in patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors towards FVIII or FIX. The objective of the trial is to establish the safety and efficacy of once-daily subcutaneous concizumab as a pen device based on prophylactic treatment to reduce the number of bleeds. A parallel phase 3 trial in haemophilia A or B patients without inhibitors, explorer8, is being initiated in November 2019. The trials are expected to enrol approximately 265 patients from 32 countries. The trials are the first pivotal trials with concizumab and the results are expected to form the basis for regulatory approval for oncedaily subcutaneous prophylaxis treatment with concizumab in all haemophilia patients with and without inhibitors.

Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved Ronapreve™(casirivimab and imdevimab) on July 21, 2021, for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 via intravenous infusion. The antibody combination was granted a Special Approval Pathway under article 14-3 of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act.
On June 11, 2020, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the start of the first clinical trial of REGN-COV2 for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. REGN-COV2 is a cocktail of the human antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987, which were derived from Regeneron’s parallel efforts using both humanized VelocImmune® mice and blood samples from recovered COVID-19 patients to generate a large and diverse collection of antibodies targeting multiple different regions of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two papers describing the creation of REGN-COV2 and its anti-viral activity have been accepted for publication in Science.

The REGN-COV2 clinical program will consist of four separate study populations: hospitalized COVID-19 patients, non-hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, uninfected people in groups that are at high-risk of exposure and uninfected people with close exposure to a COVID-19 patient. The placebo-controlled trials will be conducted at multiple sites. The first two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 studies are evaluating REGN-COV2 as a treatment for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Phase 1 portion will focus on virologic and safety endpoints, and the Phase 2 portion will focus on virologic and clinical endpoints. Data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be used to refine the endpoints and determine size for the Phase 3 studies.",None,2021,,,Casirivimab + imdevimab,Treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms) who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease becoming severe.

A high-affinity antibody was selected from a single phage clone (YW243.55.S70) on a human IgG1 backbone. Affinity measurements were conducted by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and binding to PD-L1-expressing human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Binding of MPDL3280A was strictly dependent on the expression of human PD-L1, while other monoclonal antibodies (for example, trastuzumab) did not bind to the same cells.
The selected antibody was also judged to compete with soluble PD-L1–ECD for binding to PD-1 and B7.1, either by blocking PD-L1–ECD-Fc binding to PD-1-or B7.1-expressing cells and PD-1–ECD or B7.1–ECD. The Fcdomainof MPDL3280A was engineered to render it effector-less by introducing an Asp to Ala change at position 298 in the CH2 domain of each heavy chain, which resulted in an anti-body devoid of N-linked oligosaccharides that was incapable of binding to human Fcc receptors (see US Patent US 8,214,149B2). In an in vitro assay for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (using human PBLs as effectors), the engineered anti-body was unable to mediate the killing of two cell lines transfected with human PD-L1, while efficient killing was observed using the unmodified ‘wild-type’ antibody.

A series of rabbit anti-C5 antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with human C5 protein. The screening process was designed to identify antibodies with pH-dependent antigen-binding capabilities. To accomplish this, we screened for antibodies with different binding affinities at pH 7.4 compared to pH 5.8 using ELISA and Biacore analysis. As a result, several antibodies which preferentially bind to C5 at pH7.4, but weakly at pH 5.8 were obtained. Among them, CFA0305 was chosen as a lead antibody to be further optimized based on its pH-dependent C5-binding property. After humanization of CFA0305, comprehensive mutagenesis on the antibody variable region was performed to identify mutations that improve the antigen-binding property, and combination of effective mutations gave the antibody high affinity with pH-dependent binding property (Fig. 1b). Some of histidine residues present in SKY59 were found to be important for the pH-dependent interaction.Various mutations were further applied to the variable regions of the antibody to improve pharmacokinetics (PK) and physicochemical properties, and to minimize the likelihood of immunogenicity in human. The constant region of the antibody was converted to a modified human IgG1/κ without effector functions, and engineered (M428L/N434A) to have enhanced affinity to FcRn at an acidic pH to extend the plasma half-life of the antibody.

Among IL-17 family members, IL-17F is closest in sequence to IL-17A, sharing ~50% structural homology. Description of bimekizumab:
We identified 496.g1, a humanized antibody with strong affinity for IL-17A but poor affinity for IL-17F. Affinity maturation of 496.g1 to 496.g3 greatly enhanced the affinity of the Fab fragment for IL-17F while retaining strong binding to IL-17A. As an IgG1, the affinity for IL-17A and IL-17F was 3.2 pM and 23 pM, respectively. Comparison of 496.g3 IgG1 with the commercially available anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies ixekizumab and secukinumab, by surface plasmon resonance and in a human in vitro IL-17A functional assay, showed that 496.g3 and ixekizumab display equivalent affinity for IL-17A, and that both antibodies are markedly more potent than secukinumab. In contrast to ixekizumab and secukinumab, 496.g3 exhibited the unique feature of also being able to neutralize the biological activity of IL-17F. Therefore, antibody 496.g3 was selected for clinical development for its ability to neutralize the biologic function of both IL-17A and IL-17F and was renamed bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940).

Aug 2022: Phase 3 in Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-associated Disease recruiting; NCT04200456 Phase 3 in ITP terminated (Strategic Business Decision; Not a safety decision)
H1 2022 report: UCB decided to de-prioritize the development of rozanolixizumab in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Since UCB took the decision to progress the rozanolixizumab ITP development program to Phase 3 in 2019, the treatment landscape for people living with ITP has significantly evolved. New targeted therapies, offering multiple opportunities to transform the care and management of ITP, are now available or in late-stage development. This evolution looks set to address many of the significant unmet needs faced by the ITP patient community. Taking these factors into account, UCB will not progress with the rozanolixizumab ITP development program. This allows UCB to reallocate resources to areas with higher unmet medical needs. All other rozanolixizumab programs will continue as previously communicated and announced.

Oct 2019: Oncologie announced the enrollment of the first patient in its global Phase 2 study of bavituximab in combination with Merck’s (known outside of the U.S. as MSD), anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. 
Sep 11, 2019: NCT04099641 Phase 2, Multicenter Open-label, Non-randomized Study of Bavituximab Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Cancer Who Have Progressed on or After at Least One Prior Standard Therapy started.  August 2019: Oncologie announced that it has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of Oncologie’s investigational drug Bavituximab, an antibody that blocks the activity of phosphatidylserine (PS), and Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Oncologie will conduct a Phase II single arm open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of Bavituximab in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients who have advanced gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, after they have failed at least one line of treatment. The study is expected to enroll approximately 80 patients in the U.S., United Kingdom, Korea and Taiwan. The study is anticipated to start enrollment in the second half of 2019.June 2019: Oncologie will initiate key clinical trials in the coming months, including a global proof of concept gastric cancer study with its lead compound, bavituximab, in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda).  In February 2018, Avid Bioservices and Oncologie announced that the companies have entered into an Asset Assignment and Purchase Agreement for Avid’s phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeting program including bavituximab. In addition to bavituximab, the deal includes Avid’s other PS-targeting antibodies, including betabodies, as well as certain other assets and licenses useful and/or necessary for the potential commercialization of bavituximab. 
Feb 1, 2018: Avid BioServices (formerly Peregrine Pharmaceuticals) has discontinued all R&D activity for bavituximab. There is no intent to reinitiate such activities in the future. Rather, the company is committed to being a dedicated CDMO. Peregrine announced that it is changing its name to Avid Bioservices, Inc. as part of its transition to a dedicated contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO). In addition to the name change, the company is also adopting the new NASDAQ ticker symbol ""CDMO"" (NASDAQ:CDMO). The name and ticker symbol changes will both be effective as of market open on Monday, January 8, 2018.  Phase II study of Pembrolizumab and Bavituximab for Progressive Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck by the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins planned. March 2017: Peregrine's clinical development strategy for bavituximab currently focuses on small, early-stage, proof-of-concept trials evaluating the drug in combination with other cancer treatments.  As part of this approach the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has awarded grants to support three different clinical trials of bavituximab treatment combinations. These trials will evaluate novel bavituximab combinations in glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma including an immunotherapy combination.  
Sep 2016: Peregrine's clinical development strategy for bavituximab is currently focused on small, early-stage proof-of-concept trials evaluating the drug in combination with other cancer treatments.  The intent behind this strategy is to control research and development costs, while continuing to generate clinical data to further validate bavituximab's combination potential that will be critical to bringing onboard a partner to help advance the program. March 2016: Phase 2/3 study in breast cancer suspended. Feb 2016: Company discontinued the Phase III SUNRISE trial of bavituximab in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The decision to stop the trial was based on the recommendation of the study's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) following a pre-specified interim analysis performed after 33% of targeted overall events (patient deaths) in the study were reached. Results of the analysis demonstrated that the bavituximab plus docetaxel group did not show a sufficient improvement in overall survival as compared to the docetaxel group to warrant continuation of the study.
Phase 2/3 NCT02651610 in HER2-neg breast cancer started in Dec 2015. AstraZeneca will collaborate with Peregrine Pharmaceuticals in a Phase I/Ib study to evaluate the combination of AstraZeneca's durvalumab and Peregrine's bavituximab, along with chemotherapy, as a treatment for multiple solid tumors.

Generally, serum proteins like antibodies, are transported from the serum into the cell’s endosome then to the lysosome where they are degraded. ARGX-117 is designed with an Fc backbone that is equipped with the proprietary NHance™ mutation, which is intended to enhance the binding of the antibody to FcRn in the endosome and prevent the antibody going into the lysosome for degradation. By binding to the Sushi-2 domain of C2, ARGX-117 prevents the formation of the C3 proconvertase, the C4bC2 complex, and inhibits both CP and LP activation upstream of C3.
(1) ARGX-117 binds at its variable domain to the target C2 with high affinity in the serum but lower affinity in the endosome due to the pH and Ca2+ dependent nature of the binding.
(2) The lower affinity allows C2 to dissociate from ARGX-117 in the endosome and cycle into the lysosome for destruction (3).
(4) ARGX-117 still bound to FcRn can cycle back to circulation and bind new C2 – repeating the cycle in a “sweeping” manner to continuously destroy the C2 target. With sweeping recycling properties, it is expected that ARGX-117 will remain longer in circulation and can remove several C2 molecules from circulation resulting in enhanced C2 clearance from the bloodstream.",None,None,Phase 3,Active,2020-03-01,2022-02-01,2025-01-15,"Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, Dermatomyositis, Delayed Graft Function, Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, Phase 1 is in healthy volunteers",Immune-mediated / inflammatory disorders,argenx,None,"NCT06742190 Phase 3 in Multifocal Motor Neuropathy started in Jan 2025.

1 lysozyme-like enzyme that selectively degrades the cell wall of C. difficile and causes rapid destruction of the organism.
The cocktail is comprised of homodimeric versions of three toxin-binding proteins (5D, E3, and 7F) derived from camelid single-domain antibody fragments known as VHHs or nanobodies. Each protein was previously shown to inactivate TcdB. Binding of 5D to TcdB prevents its pH-driven conformational change that enables pore formation and transit into the cytoplasm from internalised endosomes. E3 binds to the glucosyltransferase domain (GTD) of TcdB, interfering with the autoproteolysis step necessary for enzyme activation. 7F also binds to the GTD, inhibiting catalytic glucosylation/inactivation of Rho-family GTPases by the mature N-terminal glucosyltransferase.

Variable domain fragments of heavy (VH) and light chains of specific binders were used to generate full-length immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Six light chain framework mutations were introduced to make the MAA868 amino acid sequence as similar as possible to the human germline Vλ1_1c sequence (“germlining”). The VH framework (VH3-23) did not require any changes.
Genetic and pharmacologic evidence in humans and animals suggests that reducing factor XI (FXI) levels has the potential to effectively prevent and treat thrombosis with a minimal risk of bleeding. We generated a fully human antibody (MAA868) that binds the catalytic domain of both FXI (zymogen) and activated FXI. Our structural studies show that MAA868 traps FXI and activated FXI in an inactive, zymogen-like conformation, explaining its equally high binding affinity for both forms of the enzyme. This binding mode allows the enzyme to be neutralized before entering the coagulation process, revealing a particularly attractive anticoagulant profile of the antibody. MAA868 exhibited favorable anticoagulant activity in mice with a dose-dependent protection from carotid occlusion in a ferric chloride-induced thrombosis model. MAA868 also caused robust and sustained anticoagulant activity in cynomolgus monkeys as assessed by activated partial thromboplastin time without any evidence of bleeding. Based on these preclinical findings, we conducted a first-in-human study in healthy subjects and showed that single subcutaneous doses of MAA868 were safe and well tolerated. MAA868 resulted in dose- and time-dependent robust and sustained prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and FXI suppression for up to 4 weeks or longer, supporting further clinical investigation as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous anticoagulant therapy.

Onclave Therapeutics Limited is a subsidiary of Prothena (formerly Neotope Biosciences, an Elan spin-off co.)
Feb. 01, 2021: Prothena Corporation plc  announced that following further analyses by the Company and multiple in-depth discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the previous analysis of patients categorized as Mayo Stage IV at baseline in the VITAL study, Prothena is advancing birtamimab into the confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM-AL study in this category of patients with AL amyloidosis. This registration-enabling study will be conducted with a primary endpoint of all-cause mortality at p<0.10 under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with FDA.
April 18, 2019 I Prothena Corporation plc (NASDAQ:PRTA), a clinical-stage neuroscience company, today reported final results from the Phase 3 VITAL Amyloidosis study of NEOD001 (birtamimab) in newly diagnosed, treatment naïve patients with AL Amyloidosis and cardiac dysfunction (N=260), which was discontinued in 2018. The final hazard ratio (HR) for the composite primary endpoint (time to all-cause mortality or time to cardiac hospitalization more than 90 days after first infusion of study drug) of 0.835 (95% CI: 0.5799, 1.2011; p=0.3300) was consistent with the futility analysis reported in April 2018. Post hoc analyses of all-cause mortality revealed a potential survival benefit favoring NEOD001 in the category of patients at highest risk for early mortality (Mayo Stage IV, n=77) with a HR of 0.544 (95% CI: 0.2738, 1.0826; p=0.0787). This potential survival benefit was more pronounced in Mayo Stage IV patients during the initial 12 months of treatment, with a HR of 0.498 (95% CI: 0.2404, 1.0304; p=0.0556). April 2018: Prothena Corporation announced that the Company is discontinuing development of NEOD001, an investigational antibody that was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. The decision was based on results from the Phase IIb PRONTO study and a futility analysis of the Phase III VITAL study. Based on the results from the Phase 2b PRONTO study, which did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints, the Company asked the independent data monitoring committee (DMC) of the Phase 3 VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. The DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study for futility. The Company therefore decided to discontinue all development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies. Two Phase 2 studies recruiting as of Oct 2017; topline results in the Phase 2b PRONTO study (129 patients) expected in the second quarter of 2018.

February 7, 2024 – Gilead Sciences, Inc. announced it has discontinued the Phase 3 ENHANCE-3 study of magrolimab in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed all magrolimab studies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML, including related expanded access programs, on full clinical hold. These decisions follow the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee which reviewed top-line data from a planned interim analysis of ENHANCE-3 for overall survival (OS). In that analysis, magrolimab in combination with azacitidine plus venetoclax demonstrated futility and an increased risk of death was observed, primarily driven by infections and respiratory failure. Based on these results, as well as data from two other clinical studies in higher-risk MDS (ENHANCE) and AML with TP53 mutations (ENHANCE-2) where the primary analyses also demonstrated futility with an increased risk of death in the magrolimab-treatment arm, Gilead will not pursue further development of magrolimab in hematologic cancers.

Dec 2020: In 2021, GBT plans to initiate two global, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating safety and efficacy of inclacumab. These trials are designed to enhance understanding of how P-selectin inhibitors could provide clinical benefit for patients with SCD and reduce overall healthcare utilization. One study is designed to reduce the frequency of VOCs over one year in patients with SCD when treated with inclacumab (30 mg/kg) or placebo every 12 weeks. The second study will evaluate inclacumab based on a primary endpoint of 90-day hospital readmission rates following a VOC hospitalization. Participants in that trial will receive either a single dose of inclacumab (30 mg/kg) or placebo, peri-discharge following a VOC hospitalization. Approximately 50 percent of U.S. SCD patients with least two annual VOC events are re-admitted within 90 days following a VOC hospitalization.1 Initiation of both trials is expected in the first half of 2021.

Aug 2021: Regeneron is announcing that the Phase II LUMINA-1 safety and efficacy trial will be closing and that a new Phase III trial of the drug garetosmab is being planned, with initiation in 2022. The details of that trial, including the inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinical trial sites, are still under development. A Phase III trial is the next step in the drug development and regulatory review process. A decision was made to place the trial on clinical hold based on reports of fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) in the trial during the open-label portion in which all participants took the drug. As shared in their letter on June 4, stopping the study to evaluate safety and efficacy was the top priority for Regeneron. During this process, Regeneron met with the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) about the safety and efficacy of garetosmab. It is standard practice to pause clinical trials when SAEs occur to fully evaluate their connection or lack of connection to the study drug.

This has already flopped in asthma, like so many other IL-33s, but the Swiss giant thought it could help COVID patients with pneumonia. The trial was started last year and was slated to end in January; presumably, the results were not good, as Roche said in its first-quarter results presentation (PDF) today that it has been “removed from phase 2.”

We engineered it with a recently developed antibody engineering technology–the sweeping technology–which results in the very effective elimination of the specific antigen from circulation by forcing the internalization of antibody-antigen complex into cells. The effect of the latent myostatin-sweeping antibodies in increasing muscle strength and mass was tested in a muscle atrophy and muscular dystrophy mouse models. Our results showed that, by eliminating the myostatin from both skeletal muscle and from plasma, this novel and potent antibody greatly increased muscle strength and mass at about 10-fold lower doses compared to other mature myostatin antibodies or non-sweeping latent myostatin antibodies. We selected the final candidate for clinical development among them, and called it GYM329/RG6237. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2019.06.185
Anti-latent myostatin antibodies were generated in rabbits by alternatively immunizing the animals with recombinant human and mouse latent myostatin to enrich cross-reactive clones. Screening of B cell supernatants from the immunized rabbits through a binding assay identifed clones that specifcally bind the latent and not the mature myostatin. Tey were then functionally screened through the Smad3/4-binding elements-driven secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene assay. We assessed
the candidate antibodies’ inhibitory activity against BMP1-mediated activation of myostatin, and MST1032 was fnally selected as the lead antibody based on its strong activity.
The variable domain of MST1032 was humanized and engineered to confer pH-dependent binding essential for the sweeping function through a comprehensive mutagenesis method described elsewhere41. For the Fc region, human IgG1 was chosen as template and was engineered for selective and enhanced binding to the human
FcγRIIb and for stronger afnity to FcRn in acidic pH conditions. Te resulting antibody was named GYM329.

To help with the dose design, human pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical effective doses of SI–B001 were predicted by PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation. A Michaels-Menten (M-M) PK model was first used to describe the PK of SI–B001 in cynomolgus monkeys, whose parameters were allometrically scaled to humans for the simulation of human PK profiles. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of SI–B001 on different xenografts in tumor-bearing mice was quantitatively described by PK/PD models. The clinical effective doses were predicted by comparing the effective exposure (AUCs) in mice with simulated human AUCs. The clinical effective doses of SI–B001 were predicted to be over 16 mg/kg, 5–7 mg/kg or 5–6 mg/kg per week for colon cancer, head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer, respectively, which may help with the optimization of dose escalation schemes and the selection of indications for SI–B001.

Structural basis of specific inhibition of extracellular activation of pro- or latent myostatin by the monoclonal antibody SRK-015. (https://www.jbc.org/content/295/16/5404.short). Full-length human and murine Myostatin and GDF11 proteins were stably integrated into FLP-INTM T-REXTM 293 cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and expressed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Uniprot reference numbers: O14793, O08689, O95390, Q9Z1W4). Fully human anti-myostatin and anti-GDF11 antibodies were identified using a phage library displaying scFvs (single chain variable fragments)64. Separate antibody discovery campaigns were run using recombinant human proMyostatin, latent Myostatin, and proGDF11 for both positive and negative selection as appropriate to obtain antibodies with the desired binding profile. Antibodies were cloned and expressed using standard techniques, and binding profiles assessed on a FortéBio Octet QKe in various formats according to manufacturers directions (Supplementary methods). To potentially reduce immunogenicity, SRK-015 was generated from its parental version, SRK-015P, by introduction of five mutations in the variable domain. These antibodies are identical in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and have similar affinities and functional activity both in vitro and in vivo. muSRK-015P is identical to SRK-015P but contains a murine IgG1 constant region instead of a human IgG4 constant region. SRK-015, an optimized version of the best myostatin selective antibody identified in our screen (SRK-015P, P stands for “parental”). SRK-015 was engineered by replacing five resides in the variable domain of SRK-015P outside of the complementarity-determining region (the residues which contact the myostatin precursors).

It has also been Fc engineered to include the XX2 “vaccinal mutation,” for which Vir has licensed exclusive rights for all infectious diseases. The vaccinal mutations incorporated into the Fc domain of VIR-3434 act in concert to potentially trigger the correct FcGamma receptors on dendritic cells, resulting in their maturation. Targeting a conserved region of HBsAg; engineered to have an extended half-life and to potentially function as a T cell vaccine against HBV in infected patients. 
Uses Xencor's Xtend technoloy.
By engineering antibodies with modified Fc domains to enhance binding to specific Fc receptors on innate immune cells, investigators observed an enhanced protective immune response. Certain modifications (GAALIE variants) were associated with activation of dendritic cells, as well as antiviral effector T-cells, indicating induction of the adaptive arm of the immune system, which is responsible for long-term immunity. Based on this research, monoclonal antibodies programmed with improved effector function represent a potential new approach in the design of therapeutic antibodies for both the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.
Herbert “Skip” Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., study co-author and executive vice president, research, and chief scientific officer of Vir: “These data may have significant implications across a wide range of infectious diseases, and we look forward to exploring the vaccinal potential of the GAALIE-engineered antibodies we are advancing through clinical development – VIR-3434 for chronic hepatitis B and VIR-7832 for SARS-CoV-2.”

October 14, 2021 I Viridian Therapeutics, Inc. announced today the submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company is seeking authorization to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VRDN-001, an anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody in development for the treatment of thyroid eye disease.
Oct. 28, 2020 --  miRagen Therapeutics, Inc. announced it has completed the acquisition of Viridian Therapeutics, Inc. (“Viridian”), a privately held biotechnology company focused on advancing new treatments for patients with diseases that are underserved by today’s therapies. The proceeds from a private placement are intended to be used primarily to advance clinical studies of VRDN-001, a clinical-stage insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for thyroid eye disease (TED), a debilitating condition that can cause bulging eyes, or proptosis, as well as double vision and potential blindness.
miRagen’s lead candidate, VRDN-001 will be studied as a potential treatment for patients with TED. More than 100 oncology patients have previously been treated with the antibody in US and EU studies, under the name AVE-1642, enabling some understanding of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, as well as its safety and tolerability. Pending feedback from regulatory authorities, miRagen expects to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of VRDN-001 in TED in 2021.
Worldwide rights to develop and commercialize VRDN-001 for all non-oncology indications that do not use radiopharmaceuticals, including the treatment of TED, were exclusively licensed by Viridian from ImmunoGen, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, ImmunoGen received an upfront payment, and is eligible for additional developmental milestones and mid-single-digit royalty payments.

GR1501, a human IL-17A-neutralizing IgG4 monoclonal antibody. GR1501 binds human, rhesus and cynomolgus IL-17A with high affinity but does not bind to mouse IL-17A or other IL-17 family members. GR1501 effectively blocks the interaction between IL-17A and its receptor IL-17RA, thereby inhibiting IL-17A-induced CXCL1 and IL-6 release in cells and mice. In mouse air pouch model, GR1501 effectively inhibits IL-17A induced leukocytes infiltration into the air pouch. GR1501 also reduces joint swelling and inflammation in mouse arthritis model.

Aug 2023 press release: In May 2023 we had a Type B meeting with the review division at FDA to discuss the planned resubmission of our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for narsoplimab in hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (“TA-TMA”). Based on the agency’s feedback we expect to submit to FDA early next month a detailed plan for analysis of survival data from already-identified external sources.
Nov 2022: FDA's decision proposes the resubmission of the narsoplimab BLA including a comparison of the existing response data from the completed pivotal trial to a threshold derived from an independent literature analysis and evidence of increased survival from patients in the pivotal trial compared to an appropriate historical control group. It also notes that persuasive evidence of superior survival versus a well-matched historical control group could be sufficient even in the absence of the independent literature analysis. The specific approach to resubmission and its details would be determined through discussion with the review division.
June 2022, Omeros submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a request for Formal Dispute Resolution regarding the Complete Response Letter (CRL) issued by FDA last year regarding the Company’s biologics license application (BLA) for narsoplimab in the treatment of hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA). Formal dispute resolution is an official pathway that enables a sponsor to appeal a decision by an FDA division to a higher authority within FDA, in this case the Office of New Drugs (OND). Last month, in accordance with the standard dispute resolution procedure, Omeros had a formal meeting with the OND official assigned to decide the dispute. A decision is expected in August 2022.
November 18, 2020 I Omeros Corporation announced that it has completed the rolling submission of its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for narsoplimab for the treatment of hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA). Narsoplimab targets mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), the effector enzyme of the lectin pathway of complement, and has received breakthrough therapy designation and orphan drug designation from FDA for HSCT-TMA.
March 2020: In recent meetings with FDA focused on clinical as well as chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) data, FDA confirmed important aspects of Omeros’ rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) for narsoplimab in HSCT-TMA. The BLA continues on its clear path to completion. Rolling BLA started in Oct 2019. Feb 2019: FDA will consider not only accelerated approval but also regular (full) approval for OMS721 in HSCT-TMA, with the determination based on the submitted data. A rolling BLA submission is appropriate for OMS721 in this indication. Omeros plans to submit first the nonclinical sections. 
Oct 2018: OMS721 has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.  Aug. 28, 2018-- Omeros Corporation today announced that the European Commission (EC) has adopted a decision designating OMS721 as an Orphan Medicinal Product in the European Union (EU) for treatment in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The adoption by the EC follows a positive opinion for orphan designation of OMS721 in this indication by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). 
April 2018: FDA granted Breakthrough therapy designation. 
Feb. 15, 2018-- Omeros Corporation  today announced new results from the company’s ongoing Phase 2 study of OMS721 evaluating patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HCT-TMA). The data demonstrate an increase in median overall survival in HCT-TMA patients treated with OMS721 compared to a matched historical control. Omeros is scheduled and expects to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and with the European Medicines Agency to discuss the most expeditious path to approval for OMS721 in HCT-TM. Aug. 4, 2017-- Omeros Corporation today announced that OMS721 has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy June 2017: The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to Omeros' OMS721 as a treatment for IgA nephropathy. 
March 2017: Omeros met with FDA recently to discuss these data and Phase 3 development. Following review of the data, FDA suggested that Omeros apply for breakthrough therapy designation in IgAN. The discussion included accelerated approval and an expedited approach to full approval based on an endpoint of proteinuria, which could be faster than accelerated approval. Omeros is preparing its breakthrough application and a Phase 3 protocol for discussion with FDA. The Phase 3 trial in IgAN is expected to begin this year. Fast track designation granted in March 2016. Start of Phase 3 program announced on March 8, 2016; Phase 3 enrollment is expected to begin later this year and patients currently being treated in the Phase 2 trial are likely to be included in the Phase 3 program. The OMS721 Phase 3 program will consist of one clinical trial – a single-arm (i.e., no control arm), open-label trial in patients with newly diagnosed or ongoing aHUS.The FDA has awarded OMS721 both orphan drug designation for the treatment of TMAs and fast-track status for the treatment of aHUS.

Uniquely, ADG2 also showed broad and potent neutralization against a range of sarbecoviruses that pose a threat to humans and protective efficacy in murine models of SARS and COVID-19. The data show that ADG2 effectively binds to and has the potential to protect against common circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as future SARS-related viruses with pandemic potential. Adagio’s half-life engineered version of ADG2, called ADG20, could offer protection against COVID-19 for up to a year. Adagio expects ADG20 to enter Phase 1 clinical studies in early 2021. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/01/22/science.abf4830

Sep 2022: Company appears to be transitioning to a new candidate, NVD200 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies which demonstrated potent in vitro neutralizing activity against prior and current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.75 sublineages, as well as the more antigenically divergent SARS-CoV-1. This antibody combination has been selected for neutralization potency, breadth of coverage, and non-dominant epitope recognition. The antibodies in the combination target non-overlapping epitopes that are rarely targeted by endogenous neutralizing antibodies, which limits immune pressure on these sites and increases the probability of sustained utility in an evolving viral landscape. One of the antibodies in the combination is a re-engineered version of adintrevimab, the company’s most advanced product candidate, which met all primary endpoints with statistical significance in a pre-Omicron setting in global Phase 3 clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
April 2022: Based on feedback from the FDA regarding adintrevimab’s lack of neutralizing activity against the BA.2 variant, Adagio is pausing the submission of an EUA request. 
NCT04805671 Phase 1/2/3 for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 started in March 2021; NCT04859517 Phase 2/3 for prevention of COVID-19 started in April 2021.
Nov 2020: Adagio Therapeutics has raised $80m in funding to further advance best-in-class antibodies to both treat and protect against Covid-19. The company plans to use the proceeds to advance its lead antibody candidate, ADG20, into clinical development early next year for the treatment of the disease.
Precursor to AD20 described in An Engineered Antibody with Broad Protective Efficacy in Murine Models of SARS and COVID-19 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.385500v1.full.pdf). Derived from memory B cells of a 2003 SARS survivor that cross-neutralize multiple SARS-related viruses; affinity matured using yeast display. 
Adagio is a spin out of Adimab, LLC. Adagio is developing best-in-class antibodies that can broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and additional potentially emergent coronaviruses. We believe our antibodies will match or exceed the potency and coverage of conventional SARS-CoV-2 antibody programs and can be used as both therapeutic and durable prophylactic treatments. Our candidates are engineered using best-in-industry antibody discovery capabilities and are designed to maximize potency and duration of effect. Our portfolio includes multiple, non-competing antibodies with distinct binding targets, enabling a strategy that can avoid viral escape. Our lead program is expected to enter the clinic by the end of 2020. Adagio's broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies bind to a highly conserved epitope on the spike protein of multiple coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and two circulating bat coronaviruses) thereby reducing the potential risk of viral escape. They have been additionally engineered to maximize potency, with the goal of offering significant therapeutic benefit, as well as protection for multiple months following a single dose injection.
In conclusion, the potent cross-neutralizing antibodies described here bind to conserved epitopes overlapping the hACE2 binding site, thus illuminating this antigenic surface as a promising target for the rational design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. For example, the RBD epitope(s) defined by this class of antibodies could be presented on conformationally stable protein scaffolds to focus the antibody response on this site, as previously demonstrated for the motavizumab epitope on RSV F (19). Furthermore, the nAbs themselves,
alone or in combination, represent promising candidates for prophylaxis or therapy of SARS, COVID-19, and potentially future diseases caused by new emerging SARS-like viruses.

A team of researchers led by Prof. Florian Klein (Cologne University Hospital) and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) has further elucidated how these antibodies develop and has isolated potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Together with Boehringer Ingelheim, these antibodies are currently being further characterized and developed. It is expected that they will enter the stage of clinical development later this year.

(Longitudinal Isolation of Potent Near-Germline SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Antibodies from COVID-19 Patients; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32946786/)
In close collaboration with scientists from Marburg, Frankfurt, Munich, Tübingen and Israel, the researchers investigated the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in twelve individuals recovered from COVID-19. They examined more than 4000 SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells on a single cell level and were able to partly decode the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. They reconstructed 255 antibodies in the laboratory, which were examined by Prof. Stephan Becker’s laboratory in Marburg for their ability to neutralise the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In total, 28 neutralising antibodies were found.
The antibodies have been developed for protecting against and treating COVID-19. In addition, these antibodies could be used for ‘post-exposure prophylaxis. Here antibodies would be applied after contact with an infected individual. “This form of intervention could be of particularly interest for stopping localised outbreaks and for preventing disease progression in people at risk,” said Prof. Klein.

GSK Q2 2021 update: The ENTRÉE-Lung sub study 1 investigating feladilimab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone did not meet its primary endpoint at the interim analysis.
April 2021: GlaxoSmithKline has stopped two clinical trials of feladilimab in combination with Keytruda after an interim review. Other studies of the ICOS agonist are continuing, but the future of the program is now in doubt. Feladilimab, formerly known as GSK3359609, is designed to stimulate and grow cytotoxic T cells by acting on ICOS. The mechanism of action suggests ICOS agonists may enhance checkpoint inhibitors, leading GSK and Merck to start studying the combination of feladilimab and PD-1 drug Keytruda. The theory took a hit late last year when Jounce Therapeutics stopped a trial that was testing its rival ICOS candidate in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy. Now, GSK has dealt another blow to the cases for ICOS agonists. After seeing interim results from a trial in PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, the independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping the INDUCE-3 study. https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-provides-update-on-feladilimab-an-investigational-inducible-t-cell-co-stimulatory-icos-agonist/

The study achieved its primary endpoint, showing significant treatment benefit using the HiSCR endpoint, which is the method used in the development of the only therapy currently approved for the treatment of HS. However, other methods of evaluating disease severity and response to treatment have been proposed.  The iHS4 scoring system has recently been proposed as a new measure of HS disease severity 1 but its usefulness as a clinical measure has not been extensively studied. Investigators used data from the Phase 2 study to evaluate the iHS4 scoring method to see how it correlates with the HiSCR findings. 
Sep 20 2017: XBiotech Inc. announced today its agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center located in Los Angeles, California, whereby XBiotech will provide its interleukin-1 alpha antagonist, MABp1, for a Phase I single arm study evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of OnivydeⓇ (Irinotecan liposome injection) and 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in combination with MABp1 in a cohort of patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cachexia. A marketing application for this indication was considered by EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), which adopted a negative opinion, recommending the refusal of a marketing authorization, in May 2017. The opinion was based on study results that did not show clear improvements in lean body mass or quality of life; increased risk of infection in patients who received the drug; and inadequate controls of the manufacturing process. Upon the request of the applicant, XBiotech Germany GmbH, CHMP re-examined the initial opinion, and confirmed the refusal of the marketing authorization in September 2017.
June 09, 2017: XBiotech Inc. announced today that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has performed its second prospectively planned, unblinded analysis of the Phase 3 XCITE study for the Company’s novel candidate antibody therapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The IDMC had no safety concerns from the unblinded analysis. However, the committee recommended the early termination of the study since the findings were not sufficient to meet efficacy or the threshold for continuation. 
Sep 2017: EMA's outcome of re-examination. Refusal of the marketing authorisation for Human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin-1 alpha XBiotech. At the time of the initial review, the CHMP had a number of concerns. Firstly, the study did not show clear improvements in either lean body mass or quality of life. Secondly, at that time, there appeared to be an increased risk of infection in patients taking the medicine, which was not considered acceptable in vulnerable patients who will be receiving palliative care. Lastly, there were inadequate controls of the manufacturing process to ensure the medicine would have the same quality as the product used in clinical trials. During the re-examination, the Committee was reassured that no commonly reported side effects appear to be directly linked to this medicine. However, insufficient safety data are available to properly assess its overall risks and the committee still had concerns about the medicine’s benefits and manufacturing controls. The CHMP therefore maintained its opinion that the benefits of this medicine did not outweigh its risks and recommended that it be refused marketing authorisation.
March 27, 2017: XBiotech Inc. announced today that it completed on time and confirmed receipt of its March 22, 2017 submission of responses to the remaining EMA queries related to its marketing authorization application. The Company feels confident it has addressed all outstanding issues raised in the application for its candidate antibody therapy for the treatment of colorectal cancerThe Company’s marketing authorization application for Xilonix for the treatment of colorectal cancer remains on schedule to achieve a decision in 2016 by the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.

The Biologics License Application (BLA) will be reviewed under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program (RTOR program).
Inolimomab has shown a robust and long-lasting response Rate in steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGvHD) in a randomized multicentre controlled parallel-group Phase III study (INO-107 - EUDRACT 2007-005009-24). In addition, Inolimomab demonstrated a clear advantage in long-term survival compared to control group treated with ATG (Anti-Thymo Globulin).
Since December 24, 2019, the French National Agency for the Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) granted a cohort ATU for inolimomab in France in this indication (also including pediatric patients).
In June 2020, FDA accepted the application for Leukotac under the RTOR pilot program.
The next step in the BLA Submission process to the FDA will be the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) pre-BLA meeting in September 2020.

The analysis performed by Washington University School of Medicine in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) Study showed that solanezumab did not meet the primary endpoint. 
Feb 2017: Lilly terminated the double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase III EXPEDITION-PRO trial of IV solanezumab every 4 weeks for up to 2 years to treat prodromal AD after reviewing data from the double-blind, international Phase III EXPEDITION3 trial in patients with mild dementia due to AD. The company said it did not find evidence suggesting solanezumab would confer a meaningful benefit. Lilly will not pursue regulatory submissions for solanezumab for the treatment of mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. NCT01900665 Phase 3 studies in patients with mild AD recruiting as of Nov 2013. Primary endpoints, both cognitive and functional, were not met in either of the two Phase 3 trials of Alzheimer’s disease; (EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2).

September 30, 2021 I Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company, today announced a mutual decision with GSK to terminate their agreement on bintrafusp alfa, effective September 30, 2021. The decision is based on the clinical trial data generated to date, most notably the previously reported results from the INTR@PID Lung 037 study, which did not replicate the encouraging data observed in earlier studies. Based on the data generated during the agreement, no milestone payments were made by GSK and no future milestone obligations remain.
Aug 2021: Phase 2 INTR@PID BTC 055 study of the drug alongside chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) has been abandoned early. An interim look at the data by the trial’s independent monitoring committee concluded that adding bintrafusp alfa to a gemcitabine/cisplatin regimen was unlikely to show any improvement on overall survival than the chemotherapy on its own.
The failure comes after bintrafusp alfa missed the mark in a phase 2 trial as a second-line monotherapy for BTC patients who failed first-line chemotherapy in March, when GSK and Merck suggested the first-line study was the brightest prospect for the drug.
In January, it also failed to show any improvement over Merck & Co/MSD’s checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in previously-untreated patients with PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

ABP 300, referred to as MW05 in the publication, neutralizes COVID-19 by binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking the viral interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of host which are critical for viral entry and infection. Through this mechanism of action, ABP 300 not only completely and safely neutralizes COVID-19 in animal models but could potentially do so with superior safety and efficacy than other monoclonal antibodies in development.
“We are highly encouraged by this preclinical best-in-class proof-of-concept data showing the potential of our monoclonal antibodies to neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains. The data supports further development of antibody-based therapies for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19,” said Ian Chan, chief executive officer and co-founder of Abpro Corporation. “As the SARS-CoV-2 mutates, which could undermine the effectiveness of vaccines and therapies, there is an urgent need for treatments that can address a broad range of strains.”

Study highlights:
Potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in rhesus monkeys – a widely used model to assess efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 because it closely mirrors human infection and disease. A single dose of ABP 300 blocked infection of SARS-CoV-2 in prophylactic treatment and cleared SARS-CoV-2 in three days in a therapeutic treatment setting.
ABP-300 was shown to have a protective effect by alleviating the lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the monkeys whether the antibody was injected before or after the virus challenge.
ABP 300 showed high RBD binding abilities and strong ability to disrupt RBD/ACE2 binding, and effectively neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 pseudo virus and authentic live virus.
Additional antibodies from Abpro’s program, ABP-300, as known as MW05, and an additional antibody, MW07, exhibited strong binding abilities to eight high frequency mutant RBD proteins, blocking viral interactions with host cells. These results suggest both monoclonal antibodies may neutralize a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 strains.

This decision was made following receipt of a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for the tanezumab application in osteoarthritis (OA) and a negative opinion adopted by the EMA’s CHMP on the tanezumab marketing authorization application in OA.
At a meeting held September 13-16, 2021, EMA’s CHMP recommended the refusal of a marketing authorization for tanezumab for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. 
March 26, 2021: The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee voted 19 to one that while clinical data indicates tanezumab can benefit patients, the associated risk for joint destruction or rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) was too great. Pfizer is currently seeking US approval for the drug, an investigational nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitor, as a non-opioid treatment for moderate-to-severe OA pain in adults for whom the use of other analgesics is ineffective or inappropriate. 
From Lilly Q1 2021 results: In the first quarter of 2021 an Advisory Committee to the FDA concluded that the proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy will not ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. In collaboration with Pfizer, we plan to continue to work with the FDA as it continues to review the submission.
March 2, 2020: The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for the FDA to make a decision on the tanezumab application is in December 2020. In its acceptance letter, the FDA stated that it is currently planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss this application. Company Q4 Earnings Conference Call 01/28/2020: Pfizer announced that it completed the U.S. submission for tanezumab in December 2019. This submission was done in close collaboration with the FDA, and it includes the 2.5 mg dose in moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis patients. Based on a standard 12-month original BLA filing under PDUFA VI guidelines, the PDUFA decision should occur in December 2020. July 2019: Based on an assessment of the totality of subcutaneous (SC) tanezumab data and an initial discussion with the FDA during second-quarter 2019, Pfizer and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) have decided to pursue a U.S. regulatory submission for tanezumab 2.5 mg SC in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) that is expected to be filed with the FDA in fourth-quarter 2019 or early 2020, to be followed by potential regulatory filings in the EU and Japan (https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2019/q2/Q2-2019-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf). 
Jan 2019: Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) today announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating tanezumab 2.5 mg or 5 mg in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) pain. The tanezumab 5 mg treatment arm met all three co-primary endpoints at 24 weeks, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain, physical function and the patients’ overall assessment of their OA compared to those receiving placebo. The tanezumab 2.5 mg treatment arm met two of the three protocol-defined co-primary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain and physical function, while patients’ overall assessment of their OA was not statistically different than placebo.

The application seeks approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of 23 July 2025. Blenrep was originally approved by the FDA in August 2020 as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. However, the drug was later withdrawn from the market after failing to demonstrate superiority over the combination of Pomalyst plus dexamethasone in a Phase III confirmatory study. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) followed suit by not renewing the conditional marketing authorisation for Blenrep in 2023.  The current US application is based on results from the DREAMM-7 (NCT04246047) and DREAMM-8 (NCT04484623) Phase III trials. Both trials met their primary endpoints, showing statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) for the Blenrep combinations compared to standard-of-care triplet combinations. Both studies also showed clinically meaningful improvements across all other secondary efficacy endpoints. The safety and tolerability profiles of the Blenrep combinations were consistent with the known profiles of the individual agents.
