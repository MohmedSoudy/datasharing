<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
   <h2 style="color: Navy;">M3Cs version 2.0 Main Objective:</h2>
   **Objectives: **
   - The principle of this platform is, based on the translational bioinformatics spectrum, to bring miRNA research into clinical validity then clinical utility in both patient care and drug discovery using digital innovation and health informatics in childhood cancer diseases.
   - M3Cs version 2.0 seeks to contribute to the achievement of SDG Goal 3: 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages', and SDG Goal 9 'Innovation and infrastructure' especially Target 9.5, as well as SDG Goal 17 'Partnership'.

   <h2 style="color: Navy;">I- Data-Driven Clinical validity Approach:</h2>

   **Clinical Validity of microRNA:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 introduced 'clinical validity' for all microRNAs included in M3Cs using 'Consensus of M3Cs Standardized Clinical Validity Framework 2024 Version 1.0' developed by a panel of experts in the field. Pediatric cancer patients belong at the center of the discussions around clinical validity. The central message of the framework is to recognize the incremental value of the role of each microRNA as a biomarker in supporting patient care.
   - M3Cs version 2.0 systematically evaluated the 'clinical validity' of a microRNA-childhood cancer disease relationship. It will enable researchers to prioritize microRNAs for experimentation and iteration in various clinical contexts.

   **Ethnicity Effect:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 is the first platform that reports all clinical studies accompanied by patients' ethnicity. M3Cs version 2.0 follows the GWAS catalog https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ in this regard. This is crucial due to diagnostic/prognostic/predictive/risk variations seen due to this effect. 

   **miR-Polymorphism & Drug Response/miRNA Pharmacogenomics:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 reports many clinical studies about miRNAs-associated drug toxicity. This will pay attention to miRNA Pharmacogenomics to be used in contemporary treatment protocols and consequently more research in this promising field.

   **MiRNA-Based Theragnostic:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 reports clinical studies with dysregulated miRNAs and their reported direct target gene(s). It enables researchers to fuse diagnostics with targeted therapy as personalized medicines to improve both the management and outcome of many pediatric cancer diseases.

   <h2 style="color: Navy;">II- Data-Driven Human Pediatric Cancer Cell Line Model Approach:</h2>

   **miRNA Effect on The Tumor Phenotype:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 collects most human pediatric cell line studies that identify the effect of miRNA on the tumor phenotype to differentiate between miRNAs that act as a tumor suppressor or Oncogene. It enables researchers to investigate the potential use of this effect in clinical practice.

   **miRNA Value as a Targeted Therapy:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 reports human pediatric cell line studies with dysregulated miRNAs and their reported target genes along with the underlying affected downstream pathways. It will enable researchers to establish miRNA-based targeted therapy in many pediatric cancer diseases.

   **Drug Effect on miRNA Expression:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 collects most cell line studies that assess the drug effect on miRNA level, the direct target as well as the downstream pathway. It enhances drug discovery and translational research.

   <h2 style="color: Navy;">III- Data- Driven in vivo 'Animal' Approach:</h2>
   
   **miRNA Effect on tumor phenotype (tumor size and/or metastasis):** 
   - M3Cs version 2.0 collects most in vivo (animal) model studies for 16 pediatric cancer types that identify the effect of miRNA on the tumor phenotype by assessing tumor size and/or metastasis to differentiate between miRNAs that act as a tumor suppressor or Oncogene. In vivo, studies play a critical role as a confirmation of the results of cell line 'in vitro' studies and a promotion toward investigating the potential use of miRNA effect in clinical practice.

   **Drug Effect on miRNA Expression:**
   - M3Cs version 2.0 collects most in vivo 'animal' model studies that assess the drug effect on miRNA level and the tumor size and/or metastasis. This encourages researchers toward drug discovery and translational research.
